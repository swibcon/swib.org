# SWIB24 – 16th Semantic Web in Libraries Conference

## 25 – 27 November 2024, online

SWIB conference (Semantic Web in Libraries) is an annual conference, being held
for the 16th time. SWIB24 will happen online to ensure inclusion of as many
participants as possible while minimizing the ecological footprint of the conference.
An [online forum](https://forum.swib.org) serves as communication space for SWIB24 and future conferences.

SWIB focuses on Linked Open Data (LOD) in libraries and related organizations.
It is well established as an event where IT staff, developers, librarians, and
researchers from all over the world meet and mingle and learn from each other.
The topics of talks and workshops at SWIB revolve around opening data, linking
data and creating tools and software for LOD production scenarios. These areas
of focus are supplemented by presentations of research projects in applied
sciences, industry applications, and LOD activities in other areas.

As usual, SWIB24 will be organized by the **[North Rhine-Westphalian Library
Service Centre (hbz)](https://www.hbz-nrw.de/)** and **[ZBW – Leibniz Information Centre for
Economics](https://www.zbw.eu/en)**. The conference language is
English.
